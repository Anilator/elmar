A website for Elmar Ipskamp, an artist from the Netherlands.

This website uses Github as a hosting and Google's Blogger as a backend.
Data is stored in a blog and delivered by Blogger API. It may be easily updated via Blogger dashboard.

The frontend is built on jQuery only, so it's super fast and supported by any browser (IE8+ for sure).

The website is designed in "mobile first" approach to give a maximum comfort for using it on handheld devices.
